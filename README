Install script (install.sql) requires you to set a password otherwise it will fail to run.
  To do so add 'new_pass' after each IDENTIFIED BY statement. Do not use the same password
  for both users.

The next step is to update the passwords in bsecure.lib.php to match those you have set 
  in the previous step. The users are designed with a minimal permissions philosphy.

.: bsu_newuser
This user exists with the express purpose of creating new users and has no business 
  besides inserting on `bst_users` table.

.: bsu_auth
This user exists only to authenticate users and as such can only read from 
  `bst_users`. This user can however modify the `bst_online` database.
  
.: Queries and filters
Currently all queries are passed through a filter allowing only alphanumeric inputs
  from users. Should you wish, this behavior can be changed by modifing the calls to
  the query function. Filters are inverted, this means that what is matched is removed.
  For example, to match numbers only you would use [^0-9].
